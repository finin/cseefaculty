Http://bit.ly/cseeFaculty is a Google Spreadsheet listing all of the
full-time tenure-track faculty CSEE has had plus an incomplete list of
non-TT positions.

It is good to capture this history and it will be useful when we argue
for more lines.  The data shows (http://bit.ly/1gb7F9K), for example,
that even with the three new faculty for AY 2015, we will have fewer
CS TT lines than in AYs 2002-2006.

Please add anyone I've missed and correct dates that are wrong.  I
highlighted dates I was unsure about.  The data for each faculty
member includes

  -- program (C for CS or E for ECE)
  -- status (TT, PP, R, V, L, PD)
  -- first academic year in service 
  -- last academic year or blank if continuing
  -- AYs on leave (e.g., '2007 2014')

For an academic year, we use the year in which it starts, e.g, 2014
for the 2014-15 academic year.

I thought we might not worry about half years at this point.

We can use a simple Python program to create the spreadsheets and
charts we want.  Https://github.com/finin/cseefaculty is a public
GitHub repo with the data and code.

With reasonably complete data that includes lecturers we can easily
generate data for graphs and dynamic visualizations showing the
evolution of teaching faculty and staff and the number of students in
our programs.
