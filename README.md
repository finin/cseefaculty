Http://bit.ly/cseeFaculty is a google doc listing all of the full-time
tenure-track faculty our department has had.

I thought it would be useful for us to capture this history and the
data will be handy when we argue for more lines.  For example, it
shows that even with the two new CS faculty, we will have fewer CS TT
lines next year that we did in AYs 2002-2006.

Currently the data also contains POP and (some) visiting faculty and I
hope to add lecturers soon.  It does not contain research faculty.

The data for each faculty member includes 

  -- program (C for CS or E for ECE)
  -- first academic year in service
  -- last academic year in service (or blank if still in service)
  -- a list of any years they were on leave

Please take a look at the list and see if I have missed anyone or got
any of the dates wrong.  Where I was unsure of a date, I highlighted
it and added a '?' after the year.  The Google Doc is editabe so
please go ahead and make correntions.

I thought we might not worry about half years at this point.
